## 2026-03-30 - Overly Permissive Row-Level Security on Inspections Table

**Vulnerability:**
The `inspections` table was created with `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`, but contained a dangerously permissive policy `CREATE POLICY "Allow participants to read inspections" ON inspections FOR SELECT USING (true);` alongside `CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert to inspections" ON inspections FOR INSERT TO public WITH CHECK (true);`. This allowed any unauthenticated or authenticated user on the internet to read or insert inspection records, leaking sensitive geolocation data (latitude, longitude), timestamps, and image URLs of private inspections across all rentals.

**Learning:**
Developers used `USING (true)` and `WITH CHECK (true)` during initial prototyping to allow easy insertion and reading without checking user authentication or relationship to the trailer/booking.

**Prevention:**
Always restrict RLS `SELECT` policies to authenticated users who are either the owner of the resource (`user_id = auth.uid()`) or the owner of the linked parent resource (`trailer_id IN (SELECT id FROM trailers WHERE owner_id = auth.uid())`). Avoid public `USING (true)` or `WITH CHECK (true)` on tables storing private or sensitive user data.
